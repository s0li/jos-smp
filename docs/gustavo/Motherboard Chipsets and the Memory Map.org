+ There are three main ways by which the CPU and the outside
  communicate: 
  1. memory address space,
  2. I/O address space, and 
  3. interrupts.

+ In 64-bit mode it is possible to use physical addresses above the
  total RAM in the system to access the RAM regions that correspond to
  physical addresses stolen by motherboard devices. This is called
  reclaiming memory and itâ€™s done with help from the chipset.
