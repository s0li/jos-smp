- The 640KB area marked "Low Memory" was the only random-access memory
  (RAM) that an early PC could use.
- The 384KB area from 0x000A0000 through 0x000FFFFF was reserved by
  the hardware for special uses such as video display buffers and
  firmware held in non-volatile memory. 
- The most important part of this reserved area is the Basic
  Input/Output System (BIOS), which occupies the 64KB region from
  0x000F0000 through 0x000FFFFF.

- Modern PCs therefore have a "hole" in physical memory from
  0x000A0000 to 0x00100000, dividing RAM into "low" or "conventional
  memory" (the first 640KB) and "extended memory" (everything
  else). In addition, some space at the very top of the PC's 32-bit
  physical address space, above all physical RAM, is now commonly
  reserved by the BIOS for use by 32-bit PCI devices.
