* Progress [0/3]
+ [ ] figure out how to program the IOAPIC to send interrupts to
      differnet CPUs.
+ [ ] create git rep serv on home/t2
+ [ ] lapic.c - in the init function change it to be like the MIT
      version and leave the LINT0 line enabled to be able to get
      interrupts from the PIC chip.
